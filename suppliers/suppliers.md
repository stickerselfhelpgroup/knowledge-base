## How to add a supplier or experiences

When adding a new supplier, please create a new folder for the supplier with their domain name as directory name and within that directory a new md-file of the same name.
When adding an experience report, please add any images you want to add in a media subdirectory within the suppliers directory or link to an external image hoster.
See [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14494747/how-to-add-images-to-readme-md-on-github) for guidance on including images.
